Each year UCSC has never failed to mark this event, above expectation and this year is no exception in that regard. This year the theme of the event was “For an age when machines start thinking”, a theme very relevant to the current scenarios happening all over the world. This event was not restricted just to this single day. There were some pre-events including a lot of tricky brain teasers. And of course on this special day, students from universities all around the island have attended and made their day.</p>

Almost all the students of UCSC gathered in the morning to UCSC premises with enthusiastic minds to participate in the Pre IEEEXtreme Programming Competition 1.0. This was a 10-hour in-site coding competition organized by the IEEE student branch for internal students of UCSC with the main objective of preparing the undergraduates for IEEEXtreme 10.0. Participants competed as groups of 3 members each.</p>

When we look at UCSC, there were hundreds of students who participated in the competition. Teams were formed of three members each, guided by a senior IEEE member. There were hard questions indeed but some were easy which should be all coded using C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, or PHP, the supportive languages for this competition.</p>

Teams were formed of three members each, proctored by a senior IEEE member. All the teams were ambitious and eager to prove themselves. The solutions could be coded using C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, or PHP, the supportive languages for this competition.
