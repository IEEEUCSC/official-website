As we all know IEEEXtreme is a worldwide programming competition that tests our analytical skills and thinking ability to solve a particular problem. When we look at UCSC, there were hundreds of students who participated in the competition. Teams were formed of three members each, guided by a senior IEEE member. There were hard questions indeed but some were easy which should be all coded using C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, or PHP, the supportive languages for this competition.

Talking about what we achieved in competing in IEEEXtreme 10.0 is, that as we are a team running forward to answer all questions in a given period of time, the team members must have sound knowledge, communication skills, and cooperation.

The UCSC undergraduates were competing since 2011 in the IEEEXtreme competitions and it was certain that this competition is going to prove and intricate the skills of UCSC undergraduates globally as much as they did in previous years.

From all 109 teams participated most of the teams had done well. Team Morpheus is ranked top in UCSC with Sulochana Kodithuwakku, Hasanga Somarathna and Madusha Ushan in the team. They were ranked seventh in the country with a region rank of 66 and world rank of 195. Teams which achieved second and third places in UCSC team threadsafe and team Raconteurs ranked seventh and twenty-first places in the country respectively whilst the world ranks were 198 and 259 respectively.

109 teams out of the 297 teams from Sri Lanka were from UCSC. Approximately 37% of the Sri Lankan contribution was made from UCSC alone. 44 teams managed to get hold of ranks inside the first hundred within Sri Lanka. Remarkably, 25 teams have achieved positions within the first 200 teams of the R10 region.

This was a huge success compared with the last yearâ€™s achievements. All the teams were very happy about their performance at IEEEXtreme 10.0 and they all hope to take part in IEEEXtreme 11.0 in the upcoming year. As undergraduates of UCSC, we are giving our greatest gratitude to IEEE Student Branch of UCSC as well as the mentors who helped us throughout the competition. We also congratulate the teams who managed to secure good ranks in the competition.
