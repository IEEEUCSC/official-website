Game Rush was a 24 hour game development hackathon organized by the IEEE Student Branch of UCSC. This is a hackathon, aimed at building some unique and interesting games. By the competition day, each team, have to build a fully functional web or mobile game. This is the first time we organized this unique Gameathon.This hackathon was open to university undergraduates all around the country who are, or aspire to game developers.

The vision behind organizing this first time event, was based on the intention to provide a Hackathon experience, centered around exploration and experimentation for the participants who brainstormed to develop an idea into a game while also providing a platform to show their skills to industry representatives and receive mentoring from them

As the initial preparation, we planned to hold a series of workshops about Game Development prior to the hackathon with the contribution of experts in the Industry.

## Objectives
The key objective was to enhance the game development skills of the students and providing
them with the opportunity to present their innovative ideas.
