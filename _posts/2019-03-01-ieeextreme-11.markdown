IEEEXtreme 11.0 is a prestigious coding challenge hosted by IEEE to bring in talented coders from all around the world.

IEEEXtreme 11.0 is a prestigious coding challenge hosted by IEEE to bring in talented coders from all around the world into an arena of problem solving and algorithmic wizardry for a period of 24 hours.

Members from IEEE Student Branch of UCSC competed online as teams, testing their skills against each other. Being one of the most active student branches in IEEE Region 10, IEEE Student Branch of UCSC hosted the event for more than 100 undergraduates at the university premises.

Main goal of hosting IEEEXtreme was to uplift the programming skills of UCSC undergraduates as well as achieve global recognition through obtaining ranks. The organizing committee who were in charge of handling the logistics put a great effort into the success of the event. And few algorithmic workshops were done in prior months to get the new participants familiar with the coding environment.
