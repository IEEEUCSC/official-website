IEEEXtreme 11.0 is a prestigious coding challenge hosted by IEEE to bring in talented coders from all around the world into an arena of problem solving and algorithmic wizardry for a period of 24 hours.

Main goal of hosting IEEEXtreme was to uplift the programming skills of UCSC undergraduates as well as achieve global recognition through obtaining ranks. The organizing committee who were in charge of handling the logistics put a great effort into the success of the event. And few algorithmic workshops were done in prior months to get the new participants familiar with the coding environment.
