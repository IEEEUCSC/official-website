&lt;p&gt;IEEE Day theme is “Leveraging Technology for a Better Tomorrow”. While the world benefits from what’s new, IEEE focuses on what’s next. World wide celebrations demonstrate the way thousands of IEEE members in local community join together to collaborate on ideas that leverage technology for a better tomorrow. While there were lot of celebrations  happening around the globe celebrating the IEEE Day 2016 the 7th edition, UCSC IEEE student branch also celebrated the IEEE Day inspired with the theme of  “Innovation and Emerging Tech” on 4th of October at the University of Colombo School of Computing premises. Main objective of this event was to inspire and encourage the youth to obtain IEEE membership in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was organized in a greater scale. It was a success from the beginning. As we expected there were about 200 audience including undergraduates from UCSC and other universities.\r\n\r\n&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the presentation of the introductory videos and speeches, the inauguration of IEEE was celebrated by cutting the traditional cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much vital and attractive lecture sessions were conducted based on Machine Learning  by  Keshan Sodimana, Recent Trends in Cyber Security  by Ayoma Wijethunga and Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality by  Senior Director and Architecture, Mr. Anjana Somathilake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most entertaining part of the event is the interactive session conducted for participants. They were seemed more enthusiastic in this session. The session was included games and Quiz competition which was made by UCSC IEEE members using an app.\r\nHat passing\r\nTreasure hunt based on app most likely to the Pokémon game.\r\nIce-breaking – break the cup hill game including online games.\r\nFancy gifts were awarded to the winners of the above mentioned games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most enthusiastic part of the session was quiz competition. It was all about how fast you can think for the answer and the IQ knowledge you got. Two participants were able to won the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world demands the quality of youth; not a time of life, but a state of mind to achieve the greatest, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over the timidity, appetite for adventure over the love of ease. As the IEEE student branch of the nation’s premier IT institute, it is their duty to admonish the young generation about the latest technology.

The event at UCSC was organized by the UCSC IEEE Student Branch. More than 100 teams fervently participated for the Xtreme competition from the UCSC, including the UCSC IEEE Student Branch members. Teams were formed of three members each, proctored by a senior IEEE member. All the teams were ambitious and eager to prove themselves. The solutions could be coded using C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, or PHP, the supportive languages for this competition. As the first problem showed up on the screens the competition launched globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems were hard indeed. But the competitors were enjoying the experience to the best with their team members. Team work and immense efforts always do pay off and as a result most of the teams were climbing higher and higher in the competition. In the interim, refreshments were provided to the competitors for their comfort throughout the competition by the logistics team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the point that UCSC undergraduates were competing since 2011 in the IEEEXtreme Programming Competition, it was a definite fact that this competition is going to prove and elaborate the skills of the UCSC undergraduates globally in as much as it did in the previous years. The Pre IEEEXtreme sessions helped the students to gear up and equip themselves with well furnished problem solving skills and it helped the students to be familiar with the problem types and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;108 teams to be exact participated from the UCSC for IEEEXtreme 10.0.  41% (44 teams) of those teams were holding country ranks below 100. The participation of the UCSC undergraduates in this competition was spaced out even among the other universities of the region as the event was promoted frequently within the university and the UCSC IEEE Student Branch is working on stimulating and strengthening the skills of the undergraduates through awareness programs and more Pre Extreme sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are providing our utmost gratitude to all the lecturers and the staff for supporting and being there for us in every way they can. Everybody at UCSC helped in a way to make this event a success. Even the non participants stayed up all night providing refreshments to the competitors. And also we are proud of all the hard work and achievements of the competitors and congratulate them all to achieve more and more to make UCSC proud.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>UdeshUK</name></author><summary type="html">IEEEXtreme 10.0, the most competitive and challenging 24 hour global programming competition was commenced at 05.30 a.m in Sri Lankan time on 22nd of October 2016.

When we look at UCSC, there were hundreds of students who participated the competition. Teams were formed of three members each, guided by a senior IEEE member. There were hard questions indeed but some were easy which should be all coded using C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, or PHP, the supportive languages for this competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about what we achieved in competing in IEEEXtreme 10.0 is, that as we are a team running forward to answer all questions in a given period of time, the team members must have a sound knowledge, communication skills and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UCSC undergraduates were competing since 2011 in the IEEEXtreme competitions and it was certain that this competition is going to prove and intricate the skills of UCSC undergraduates globally as much as they did in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From all 109 teams participated most of the teams had done well. Team Morpheus is ranked top in UCSC with Sulochana Kodithuwakku, Hasanga Somarathna and Madusha Ushan in the team. They were ranked seventh in the country with a region rank of 66 and world rank of 195. Teams which achieved second and third places in UCSC, team threadsafe and team Raconteurs ranked seventh and twenty-first places in the country respectively whilst the world ranks were 198 and 259 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;109 teams out of the 297 teams from Sri Lanka were from UCSC. Approximately 37% of the Sri Lankan contribution was made from UCSC alone. 44 teams managed to get hold of ranks inside the first hundred within Sri Lanka. Remarkably, 25 teams have achieved positions within the first 200 teams of the R10 region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a huge success compared with the last year’s achievements. All the teams were very happy about their performance at IEEEXtreme 10.0 and they all hope to take part in IEEEXtreme 11.0 in the upcoming year. As undergraduates of UCSC, we are giving our greatest gratitude to IEEE Student Branch of UCSC as well as the mentors who helped us throughout the competition.

Each of those easy type questions carried 100-150 points. Each hour they released a challenge and these challenges were getting harder gradually. The final challenge was the hardest one which carried 300 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the students attempted the challenges throughout the competition with the same enthusiasm which they had in the morning. Members of the each team got together and solved the problems while discussing and helping each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students were given their lunch. After having their lunch,  they started to attempt the challenges again. Most of the students used python as the language while some others attempt them using different languages such as C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 6.00 p.m. competition was finished and winners were announced. Team ‘void_xtream’ was the team who won the first place and the members of the team were Oshan Mudannayake, Sumedha Dissanayake and Pramodya Abeysinghe. The second place was won by team ‘whileloop_1’ and the third place was won by ‘dire’ team ‘’. Winners received book vouchers as gifts. The competition was wind up by taking the group photo of the participants.

As a very prominent community in our faculty, the IEEE student branch consider it their responsibility to work tirelessly towards contributing to make UCSC undergraduates emerge experts in the vast field of computing, and to assist them in making their innovative conceptions become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IEEEXtreme 7.0 – organizing and preparations, IEEEXtreme being a major event held annually, which sees the participation of many young coders from around the globe each year, marks a very significant occasion in the IEEE student branch calendar, since a considerable portion of the organizing and preparation of students of UCSC for the competition, falls solely upon their shoulders. Hence, preparations towards making this year’s Xtreme competition a success have commenced immediately following the completion of IEEEXtreme 6.0, which too was organized commendably well. A practical session is being continued weekly to ensure the fact that intended participants are well prepared for the extremely competitive environment they are bound to encounter at the competition. It’s our hope that the consequences of such measures would prove to be immensely favorable, and that the results of IEEEXtreme 7.0 would see massive improvement, compared to previous years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition on algorithms ,A competition on algorithms is scheduled to be held on the 8th of May, 2013, for undergraduates of all years. Thorough knowledge of algorithms accounts a great deal for achieving a satisfactory score in IEEEXtreme, and numerous other coding competitions. Lack of familiarity with algorithms proved to be a huge set back in achieving better results at the Xtreme competition last year as well, since a major portion of such algorithms are included only in the latter part of the syllabus. Hence, the IEEE student branch has initiated this competition with the intention of encouraging students of all years to learn such algorithms on their own, and test how well equipped they are with such knowledge, to apply those in practical scenarios. It’s their belief that providing with a platform for fresher men and sophomores to compete with their seniors, would grant them the opportunity to enhance their skills a great deal.Android software development session , \r\nAndroid development being an area which has rapidly conquered the industry, IEEE student branch members intend to initiate a session on the subject, mainly targeting the 1st years of UCSC, starting from their 2nd semester. Triggering a passion for learning such development methods would hopefully contribute a lot to produce better software developers to the industry, and providing them with such knowledge in the 1st year itself is indeed praiseworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website development session , \r\nThe demand for web developers has never been reduced up to this date, and it’s to cater this need itself that the IEEE student branch of UCSC has decided to improve the web development skills of its undergraduates. This too is mainly intended for the fresher men, and is to be commenced from 2nd semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech talk series , \r\nFinding solutions for problems in the field of computing, has never been more effective, than through discussion. Hence our student branch has taken measures to initiate a tech talk series, as requested by 2nd years, and provide with the perfect platform for amateurs to interact with experts, and seek assistance in improving their skills. Furthermore, this would allow the more knowledgeable ones to share their knowledge, and enhance their own skills as well, through discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joined workshop (CSR) with CompSoc , \r\nAs organized each year, in collaboration with the computer society of UCSC (CompSoc), a workshop would be held for the benefit of less privileged children from rural areas, to help them reach greater heights in the world of IT. This is to take place during the latter part of the holidays of this semester, and members of the student society intend to work towards making this year’s event as successful as the previous years, and to make it very beneficial for the intended audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robotics development , \r\nSince robotics is very closely related with the software industry, and since their exist many a young students in UCSC who are robotic enthusiasts, IEEE student branch has decided to give them a helping hand in improving their skills, and putting it to practical use. In fact the responsibility of leading this project was taken up by a 2nd year, who possesses immense experience in the field of robotics and innovation. The fact that a mere 2nd year has the capability of being in charge of this proves what potential lies within the students of UCSC, and the student branch sincerely believe in the necessity of providing them with the opportunity to express their talent to the world. This too is to commence from the 2nd semester, and it’s our hope that such sessions would encourage students to take part in robotics competitions held regionally and internationally.\r\n\r\n&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>UdeshUK</name></author><summary type="html">Year 2013 has proven to be a much eventful one already , for the enthusiastic members of the IEEE student branch of UCSC, with more to anticipate prior to the end of this year.
