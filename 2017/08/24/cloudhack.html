      <p>It was a remarkable chapter in the history of IEEE Student Branch of UCSC. The first ever cloud based hackathon, CloudHack’17 came to an end on 13th of August at UCSC with great success. Now let’s retrace the steps of their successful journey.\r\n</p>

<p>CloudHack’17 was organized by the IEEE Student Branch of University of Colombo School of Computing in collaboration with the Google Developer Group Sri Lanka. The primary intention of the event was to instil the potential of cloud computing as a powerful tool in developing solutions having both real world implications and demanding computational requirements. It was a 24 hour hackathon and 10 teams consisting of 4 members were selected out of all the applicants from local universities. The event was sponsored by MilenniumIT and Pulse Solutions and the media sponsor was Pahasara UCSC.</p>

<p>The organizing committee did a tremendous work of planning this event right from the beginning. Two workshops were organized before the event to give an understanding to the participants about cloud technologies. The first introductory workshop was on Google Cloud Platform and Cloud SQL and the second workshop was based on Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>After so much of hard work the first ever cloud based hackathon’s opening ceremony took place on 12th of August at UCSC. Prof. K. P. Hewagamage made an inspiring speech as the chief guest and the selected 10 teams started the hackathon at 9am with so much of excitement and energy. The event was well organized to give the best environment for the participants to reach their potentials. There were mentors from Sysco Lab and GDG to help and guide the participants. The teams had to present their ideas to the judges after 20 hours of developing their project ideas. \r\n</p>

<p>Then the award ceremony took place where the winners were awarded with cash prizes and the judges with tokens of appreciation. It was an amazing event and a great experience for all the participants. Congratulations for all the winning teams and well wishes to the IEEE Student Branch of UCSC for a successful journey ahead.\r\n</p>

<p>Sponsors 	: MIT, Pulse Solutions\r\n\r\nDate		: 2017.08.24\r\n\r\nVenue		: Room W002 at UCSC\r\n\r\nAudience	: Undergraduates from local universities\r\n</p>
